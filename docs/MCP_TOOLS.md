## Tool Details

### search

Searches all 584 799+ D365FO symbols. Understands type filters so you can narrow results.

**Supported types:** class, table, method, field, enum, edt

**Examples:**
```
Find classes related to sales invoice posting
Search for tables used in customer management
Find methods that calculate tax
Find fields named Invoice across all tables
Find EDT for ItemId
```

---

### batch_search

Runs multiple searches in a single call — about 3× faster than asking one by one.
Use it when you need information about several unrelated things at once.

**Examples:**
```
Find SalesTable, CustTable, and LedgerJournalTrans at the same time
Search for dimension classes, ledger services, and posting controllers
```

---

### search_extensions

Same as **search** but filters to only your custom/ISV code. Use this when you want to
avoid noise from the 500 000+ standard Microsoft symbols.

**Examples:**
```
Find all my ISV_ classes
Show me custom extensions for CustTable
Search for AslCore helper classes
```

---

### get_class_info

Returns the complete class definition: every method with its full signature and source code,
the inheritance chain (extends/implements), and any attributes.

**Examples:**
```
Show me all methods on CustTable
What does the SalesFormLetter class do?
Show me the full source of DimensionAttributeValueSet
```

---

### get_table_info

Returns the full table schema: every field with its data type and EDT, all indexes (including
which is the primary key), and every foreign key relation.

**Examples:**
```
What fields does SalesLine have?
Show me all relations on InventTable
What is the primary key of CustTable?
```

---

### get_enum_info

Returns all values of an enum with their integer values and labels. Use this for enums only.
For Extended Data Types (EDT), use **get_edt_info** instead.

**Examples:**
```
What values does SalesStatus have?
Show me all NoYes enum values
List values of InventTransType
```

---

### get_edt_info

Returns the complete Extended Data Type (EDT) definition including base type (Extends), enum type,
reference table, string/number constraints, labels, and all EDT properties from AxEdt metadata.

**Use this when you need:**
- Base type inheritance chain (which EDT extends which)
- Reference table and relation type
- String size, display length, number of decimals
- Label, help text, and form help references
- Configuration keys and other EDT properties

**Examples:**
```
Show me EDT properties for CustAccount
What is the base type of ItemId?
Show me the reference table for RecId EDT
What is the string size of Name EDT?
```

---

### get_method_signature

Extracts the exact signature of a method including modifiers, return type, and all parameters
with their default values. Essential before writing a Chain of Command extension — using the
wrong signature always causes a compilation error.

**Examples:**
```
Get the signature of SalesTable.validateWrite()
What parameters does InventTable.initFromTable() take?
```

---

### find_references

Performs a where-used search across the entire codebase. Works for classes, methods, tables,
fields, and enums.

**Examples:**
```
Where is DimensionAttributeValueSet used?
Find all callers of CustTable.validateWrite()
Which classes reference the SalesLine.RemainSalesPhysical field?
```

---

### get_query_info

Returns the complete query structure: all datasources, joins, field lists, and range definitions.

**Examples:**
```
Analyze CustTransOpenQuery
Show me joins in LedgerJournalTrans query
What ranges does InventOnHand query have?
```

---

### get_view_info

Returns view or data entity structure including fields (mapped and computed), relations,
primary key, and methods. Works for both AxView and AxDataEntityView objects.

**Examples:**
```
Show me GeneralJournalAccountEntryView structure
List fields and relations on CustomerV3Entity
What is the primary key of VendorV2Entity?
```

---

### get_form_info

Parses form XML and returns all datasources (with their fields and methods), the control
hierarchy (buttons, grids, groups), and form-level methods.

**Examples:**
```
Show me the datasources in SalesTable form
List all buttons on the CustTable form
What methods does the SalesCreateOrder form have?
```

---

### analyze_code_patterns

Analyzes your actual codebase to find the most common classes, methods, and dependencies
used in a given scenario. Use this before generating code to make sure Copilot follows
your team's real patterns, not generic templates.

**Examples:**
```
Analyze patterns for ledger journal creation
What are the common patterns for helper classes in my code?
Show me patterns for financial dimension handling
```

---

### get_api_usage_patterns

Shows how a specific API class or method is actually used in your codebase: typical
initialization code, common method call sequences, and related APIs.

**Examples:**
```
How do I correctly use DimensionAttributeValueSet?
Show me how LedgerJournalEngine is typically initialized
How is InventDim used in my code?
```

---

### generate_code

Generates X++ boilerplate code for common patterns. Always call analyze_code_patterns first
so the generated code matches your environment.

**Supported patterns:**

| Pattern | Use it for |
|---------|-----------|
| `class` | Standard X++ class (also the base for CoC extensions) |
| `runnable` | Class with `main()` for direct execution or one-off scripts |
| `form-handler` | Form extension with `init()`, `close()`, and datasource events |
| `data-entity` | Data entity class with `find()`, `exist()`, `validateWrite()` |
| `batch-job` | SysOperationServiceController + service class with `process()` |
| `table-extension` | Table extension with `validateWrite()`, `modifiedField()` |

**Examples:**
```
Generate a batch job class for inventory reconciliation
Create a table extension for InventTable
Generate a data entity for customer master data
```

---

### create_d365fo_file

Creates a physical D365FO XML file in the correct AOT location on a local Windows VM.
The server reads your `.rnrproj` to determine the model name automatically — so the file
always ends up in your custom model, not a Microsoft standard model.

Optionally adds the file to your Visual Studio project in one step.

When the package name differs from the model name, pass `packageName` explicitly
(e.g., `CustomExtensions`). In UDE environments, the server resolves it automatically
from descriptor XML files. In traditional environments, it defaults to the model name.

**Requires:** MCP server running on a local Windows machine with file system access.

**Examples:**
```
Create a class MyHelper and add it to my project
Create a table extension for InventTable in my model
Create a class in the CustomExtensions package, Contoso Utilities model
```

---

### generate_d365fo_xml

Returns the D365FO XML content as text. Works everywhere — Azure, local, any OS.
Copilot then writes the content to a file using VS Code's file tools.

Use this when the MCP server is hosted in Azure and does not have local file system access.

---

### modify_d365fo_file

Edits an existing D365FO XML file safely:

1. Creates a backup (`.bak`) before touching anything
2. Makes the change (add/edit/remove a method or field)
3. Validates that the XML is still well-formed
4. Rolls back from the backup if anything goes wrong

Supports `packageName` parameter for when the package name differs from the model name.
In UDE environments this is auto-resolved; in traditional environments it defaults to
the model name.

**Requires:** MCP server running on a local Windows machine with file system access.

**Examples:**
```
Add a method calculateDiscount() to MyCustomHelper
Add a field CreditStatus to MyCustomTable
```

---

### search_labels

Performs full-text search across all indexed AxLabelFile labels. Searches label IDs, text
content, and developer comments simultaneously. Returns labels in ranked order with ready-to-use
`@LabelFileId:LabelId` reference syntax.

> **Always call this before `create_label`** — reusing an existing label avoids duplication
> and saves translation effort.

**Parameters:**
- `query` — text to search for (required)
- `language` — filter by locale, e.g. `en-US` (default: `en-US`)
- `model` — restrict to one model, e.g. `AslCore`
- `labelFileId` — restrict to one label file ID
- `limit` — max results (default: 30)

**Examples:**
```
Find a label for the text "customer account"
Search for labels about "batch" in the AslCore model
Find labels matching "vendor" in English
```

---

### get_label_info

Has two modes depending on whether you pass a label ID:

**Mode A — list label files** (no `labelId`): Shows all AxLabelFile IDs available in a
model, the languages they contain, and how many labels each file has.

**Mode B — show translations** (with `labelId`): Shows all language translations for a
specific label, including the developer comment, and generates ready-to-use X++ and XML
code snippets.

**Examples:**
```
What label files does the AslCore model have?
Show me all translations of label ACFeature in AslCore
Show me the X++ snippet for label BatchGroup
```

---

### create_label

Adds a new label to every language `.label.txt` file in a model. Inserts the entry
alphabetically (as required by the D365FO label file format), creates the AxLabelFile XML
descriptors if the model doesn't have any yet, and updates the MCP index so the new label
is immediately searchable.

> **Always call `search_labels` first** to verify the label doesn't already exist.

**Parameters:**
- `labelId` — new label ID, e.g. `MyNewField` (required)
- `labelFileId` — target label file, e.g. `AslCore` (required)
- `model` — model name, e.g. `AslCore` (required)
- `translations` — array of `{ language, text }` objects (required); provide all supported
  languages
- `defaultComment` — developer comment added to each translation
- `packageName` — package name for label file location; auto-resolved from model if omitted
- `packagePath` — override base path (default: auto-detected from environment)
- `createLabelFileIfMissing` — create AxLabelFile structure from scratch if needed
- `updateIndex` — immediately update the MCP index (default: `true`)

**Label reference syntax after creation:**
- In X++ code: `literalStr("@AslCore:MyNewField")`
- In metadata XML: `<Label>@AslCore:MyNewField</Label>`

**Examples:**
```
Create label MyNewField in the AslCore model with translations for en-US, cs, de, and sk
Add a new label CustomerAccountNumber with English text "Customer account number"
```

## Tips

**You never need to name tools directly.** Just describe what you want:

- "Show me..." → uses get_class_info or get_table_info
- "Find..." → uses search or find_references
- "Create..." → uses analyze_code_patterns + generate_code + create_d365fo_file
- "Extend..." → uses get_method_signature + generate_code

**Be specific for best results:**
- Vague: "Find customer stuff"
- Better: "Find methods on CustTable for updating the credit limit"

**For CoC extensions, always get the signature first:**
```
Get the signature of CustTable.validateWrite()
Now create a CoC extension that adds credit limit validation
```
