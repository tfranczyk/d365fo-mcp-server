# MCP Configuration (.mcp.json)

The `.mcp.json` file tells the MCP server where your D365FO project lives. Without it the
server still works, but file creation may land in the wrong model.

---

## Minimal Configuration

Place this file in the root of your Visual Studio solution (next to the `.sln` file):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "d365fo-mcp-tools": {
      "url": "https://your-server.azurewebsites.net/mcp/"
    },
    "context": {
      "workspacePath": "K:\\AosService\\PackagesLocalDirectory\\YourPackageName\\YourModelName"
    }
  }
}
```

That is all most users need. From this single path the server automatically derives:

| Derived value | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| `packagePath` | `K:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory` |
| `packageName` | `YourPackageName` |
| `modelName`   | `YourModelName` |

The server will also:
- Automatically find your `.rnrproj` file in the open workspace
- Write any new files to the right location under PackagesLocalDirectory

---

## Transport Modes

### stdio (recommended for local / single-developer setup)

The server is launched directly by the MCP client as a subprocess. No HTTP server, no port.
VS 2022 and VS 2026 both support this via the `command:` key.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "d365fo-mcp-tools": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\d365fo-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DB_PATH": "C:\\path\\to\\d365fo-mcp-server\\data\\xpp-metadata.db",
        "LABELS_DB_PATH": "C:\\path\\to\\d365fo-mcp-server\\data\\xpp-metadata-labels.db",
        "D365FO_SOLUTIONS_PATH": "K:\\repos\\MySolution\\projects"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Key points:
- `DB_PATH` / `LABELS_DB_PATH` must be **absolute paths** — the server's working directory in
  stdio mode is controlled by the client, not the repo folder.
- `D365FO_SOLUTIONS_PATH` — folder containing your `.rnrproj` files. The server scans it at
  startup and auto-detects the model name. Required for reliable model detection.
- No `context` block needed — model name is resolved from `.rnrproj` automatically.
- `MCP_SERVER_MODE` defaults to `full` — omit it unless you need `read-only` or `write-only`.

#### Enabling diagnostics

Add `DEBUG_LOGGING` and `LOG_FILE` to the `env` block to capture a full session trace:

```json
"env": {
  "DB_PATH": "C:\\path\\to\\data\\xpp-metadata.db",
  "LABELS_DB_PATH": "C:\\path\\to\\data\\xpp-metadata-labels.db",
  "D365FO_SOLUTIONS_PATH": "K:\\repos\\MySolution\\projects",
  "DEBUG_LOGGING": "true",
  "LOG_FILE": "C:\\Temp\\d365fo-mcp.log"
}
```

The log file collects all output including JSON-RPC messages and is useful when the VS 2022
Output window is too noisy or truncated. Open it with any text editor or watch live with:

```powershell
Get-Content "C:\Temp\d365fo-mcp.log" -Encoding UTF8 -Wait
```

### HTTP (Azure-hosted or `npm run dev`)

The server listens on a TCP port. Used for Azure deployments and for local `npm run dev` sessions.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "d365fo-mcp-tools": {
      "url": "https://your-server.azurewebsites.net/mcp/"
    },
    "context": {
      "workspacePath": "K:\\AosService\\PackagesLocalDirectory\\YourPackageName\\YourModelName"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: VS 2022 HTTP transport does **not** send workspace headers. Use `workspacePath` or
`projectPath` in the `context` block, or switch to stdio.

---

## All Configuration Options

### Traditional

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "d365fo-mcp-tools": {
      "url": "https://your-server.azurewebsites.net/mcp/"
    },
    "context": {
      "workspacePath": "K:\\AosService\\PackagesLocalDirectory\\YourPackageName\\YourModelName",
      "projectPath": "K:\\VSProjects\\MySolution\\MyProject\\MyProject.rnrproj"
    }
  }
}
```

### UDE (Unified Developer Experience)

For UDE environments using Power Platform Tools in VS2022, the server supports dual metadata
roots — one for your custom code and one for Microsoft standard packages:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "d365fo-mcp-tools": {
      "url": "https://your-server.azurewebsites.net/mcp/"
    },
    "context": {
      "modelName": "YourModelName",
      "customPackagesPath": "C:\\CustomXppCode",
      "microsoftPackagesPath": "C:\\Users\\...\\Dynamics365\\10.0.2428.63\\PackagesLocalDirectory",
      "devEnvironmentType": "ude"
    }
  }
}
```

In most UDE setups you do not need to set these manually — the server reads your XPP config
files from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Dynamics365\XPPConfig\` and detects the paths automatically.

### All Properties

| Property | Required | What it does |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `workspacePath` | Recommended | Path to your model: `...\PackagesLocalDirectory\PackageName\ModelName`. All three values are derived from it automatically. |
| `packagePath` | Optional | Base PackagesLocalDirectory path. Auto-extracted from `workspacePath` — only needed when `workspacePath` is not set. |
| `modelName` | Optional | Explicit model name override — only needed when it differs from the last `workspacePath` segment. |
| `customPackagesPath` | Optional | UDE: Custom X++ code root (from XPP config `ModelStoreFolder`). |
| `microsoftPackagesPath` | Optional | UDE: Microsoft X++ root (from XPP config `FrameworkDirectory`). |
| `devEnvironmentType` | Optional | `auto` (default), `traditional`, or `ude`. Controls path resolution behavior. |
| `projectPath` | Optional | Full path to your `.rnrproj` file. Auto-detected from roots/list (stdio) or D365FO_SOLUTIONS_PATH. |
| `solutionPath` | Optional | Visual Studio solution folder. Used when `projectPath` is not set. |

### Environment Variables (stdio `env` block)

| Variable | Required | What it does |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| `DB_PATH` | Yes (stdio) | Absolute path to `xpp-metadata.db`. Must be absolute — cwd is not the repo folder in stdio mode. |
| `LABELS_DB_PATH` | Yes (stdio) | Absolute path to `xpp-metadata-labels.db`. Same reason as DB_PATH. |
| `D365FO_SOLUTIONS_PATH` | Recommended | Folder containing D365FO `.rnrproj` files. Server scans it at startup for model auto-detection and lists all found projects in `get_workspace_info`. Required for project switching by name (`projectName` parameter). |
| `MCP_SERVER_MODE` | No | `full` (default), `read-only`, or `write-only`. Only needed in hybrid setups. |
| `MCP_FORCE_HTTP` | No | Set to `true` to prevent stdio mode even when stdin is piped (rare). |
| `DEBUG_LOGGING` | No | Set to `true` to enable verbose raw JSON-RPC trace on stderr. Every message VS 2022 sends to the server (`[VS→MCP]`) and every reply the server sends back (`[MCP→VS]`) is printed with a relative timestamp. Useful for diagnosing handshake failures or unexpected tool responses. Works in both stdio and HTTP mode. |
| `LOG_FILE` | No | Absolute path to a log file (e.g. `C:\\Temp\\d365fo-mcp.log`). All stderr output — including JSON-RPC trace when `DEBUG_LOGGING=true` — is **tee'd** to this file in addition to the normal stderr stream. The file is opened in append mode at process startup, so multiple sessions accumulate in one file. A banner line with the timestamp and PID is written at the start of each session. Useful on Windows where the VS 2022 Output window truncates long lines and does not persist across sessions. |

### When do you need the optional properties?

You only need to set `projectPath` or `solutionPath` explicitly if:
- You have **multiple D365FO projects** in one solution and need to pin a specific one
- Your `.rnrproj` is in an **unusual location** that auto-detection cannot find
- You want to **override** what GitHub Copilot auto-detects

You only need to set `customPackagesPath` or `microsoftPackagesPath` if:
- You are using UDE and the **auto-detection from XPP config files** is not working
- You want to **override** the paths discovered from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Dynamics365\XPPConfig\`

## How Path Resolution Works

When the server needs to create a file, it resolves the target path in this order:

**Traditional mode:**

1. **Tool argument** — if the tool call itself includes a `packagePath`, that wins
2. **`.mcp.json` packagePath** — explicit value from the config file
3. **Auto-extracted from `workspacePath`** — everything up to `PackagesLocalDirectory` is used as the base
4. **Default fallback** — `K:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory`

**UDE mode:**

1. **`.mcp.json` context** — `customPackagesPath` / `microsoftPackagesPath`
2. **XPP config auto-detection** — reads `ModelStoreFolder` and `FrameworkDirectory` from the config file selected by `XPP_CONFIG_NAME` (or the newest) in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Dynamics365\XPPConfig\`
3. **Fallback** — existing `PACKAGES_PATH` env var or `packagePath` from `.mcp.json`

In D365FO, a package can contain multiple models (e.g., package "CustomExtensions" may contain
models "Contoso Utilities" and "Contoso Reporting"). The two-level `workspacePath` format
(`PackagesLocalDirectory\PackageName\ModelName`) encodes both, so the server knows exactly
which package directory to write to without any descriptor XML scanning. In UDE mode, the server
also auto-resolves package names by reading descriptor XML files. In traditional mode, it defaults
to assuming package name equals model name.

For the model name used when creating files:
1. **Explicit `modelName`** in `.mcp.json` context — always wins
2. **Last segment of `workspacePath`** — only when the path contains `PackagesLocalDirectory` (AOT paths). Skipped for repo paths like `K:\repos\Contoso` to avoid returning the repo folder name instead of the real model.
3. **Auto-detected from `.rnrproj`** — triggered by roots/list protocol (stdio), `D365FO_SOLUTIONS_PATH` scan, or workspace seed from env vars
4. **`D365FO_MODEL_NAME`** env var — last resort fallback

Each resolved value and its detection source are visible in `get_workspace_info` output.

---

## File Location

The server searches for `.mcp.json` starting from the current working directory and
walking up to 5 parent levels. Place it in the solution root for best results:

```
K:\VSProjects\MySolution\
├── .mcp.json          ← place here
├── MySolution.sln
└── MyProject\
    └── MyProject.rnrproj
```

---

## Common Mistakes

**Wrong model when creating files**
If new files end up inside a Microsoft standard model (ApplicationSuite, etc.),
add `workspacePath` pointing to your custom model folder. The server will then
extract the correct model name from the `.rnrproj` in your workspace automatically.

**Backslashes on Windows**
In JSON, backslashes must be doubled: `K:\\AosService\\` not `K:\AosService\`.

---

## Hybrid Setup (Azure + Local)

When the MCP server is deployed to Azure, `create_d365fo_file`, `modify_d365fo_file`, and
`create_label` cannot write to the local Windows VM file system. The **hybrid setup** solves
this by running two servers simultaneously:

| Instance | Runs on | `MCP_SERVER_MODE` | Tools |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| `d365fo-azure` | Azure App Service | `read-only` | 36 search & analysis tools |
| `d365fo-local` | Windows VM (stdio) | `write-only` | `create_d365fo_file`, `modify_d365fo_file`, `create_label`, `rename_label`, `verify_d365fo_project`, `get_workspace_info` |

GitHub Copilot connects to both servers at the same time and selects the right one automatically.

### .mcp.json for hybrid setup

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "d365fo-azure": {
      "url": "https://your-server.azurewebsites.net/mcp/"
    },
    "d365fo-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["K:\\d365fo-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_MODE": "write-only",
        "D365FO_SOLUTIONS_PATH": "K:\\VSProjects\\MySolution"
      }
    },
    "context": {
      "workspacePath": "K:\\AosService\\PackagesLocalDirectory\\YourPackageName\\YourModelName"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The `--stdio` argument is no longer needed — the server detects stdio mode
> automatically via `process.stdin.isTTY`.

### How it works

1. `d365fo-azure` starts with `MCP_SERVER_MODE=read-only` → only exposes search/analysis tools
2. `d365fo-local` starts with `MCP_SERVER_MODE=write-only` → only exposes file-operation tools
3. GitHub Copilot aggregates both tool lists — from Copilot's perspective it sees all 53 tools
4. When Copilot calls `create_d365fo_file`, it goes to the local server which has K:\ access
5. When Copilot calls `search`, it goes to the Azure server with the full metadata database

### Verifying the tool filtering

When the server starts, it logs the detected mode and tool count:

**Write-only mode (local companion):**
```
🔧 Server mode: write-only (from env: write-only)
🎯 Registered 6 X++ MCP tools (create_d365fo_file, modify_d365fo_file, create_label, rename_label, verify_d365fo_project, get_workspace_info)
[MCP Server] Tool list filtered for write-only mode: 6 tools (create_d365fo_file, modify_d365fo_file, create_label, rename_label, verify_d365fo_project, get_workspace_info)
```

**Read-only mode (Azure server):**
```
🔧 Server mode: read-only (from env: read-only)
🎯 Registered 38 X++ MCP tools (all except local tools)
[MCP Server] Tool list filtered for read-only mode: 38 tools (local tools excluded)
```

**Full mode (local development):**
```
🔧 Server mode: full (from env: not set, defaulting to full)
🎯 Registered 53 X++ MCP tools (full mode)
[MCP Server] Tool list in full mode: 53 tools (no filtering)
```

> **Note:** The local server in `write-only` mode skips database download and the symbol
> index entirely — it only needs `.mcp.json` for path resolution. Redis and Azure Blob Storage
> are not required. `get_workspace_info` and `verify_d365fo_project` are included in
> `write-only` mode because they read local K:\ filesystem paths not accessible from Azure.

### Azure App Service settings for read-only mode

The `MCP_SERVER_MODE=read-only` environment variable is **automatically set** when deploying via:
- The Bicep infrastructure template (`infrastructure/main.bicep`)
- The Azure DevOps deployment pipeline (`.azure-pipelines/d365fo-mcp-app-deploy.yml`)

If you're deploying manually or through a different method, ensure you add this setting in your Azure App Service configuration:

```
MCP_SERVER_MODE=read-only
```

This ensures write tools are never advertised over the public URL, even if someone calls them directly.
